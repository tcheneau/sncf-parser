# SNCF "Mon Forfait Annuel" parser

I was kind of bored of having to go on the website to get my schedule. So I did a little Golang "script" to extract the information I'm interested.

## How it works

1. Save the schedule page from the SNCF "Mon Forfait Annuel" website
2. Run my little program on it:

   ./scnf-parser "Mes RÃ©servations.html"

3. Enjoy
